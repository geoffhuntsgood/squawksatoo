# Squawksatoo

A fun little app that randomly selects specific bananas for you to go and find while playing Donkey Kong Bananza. Hosted at https://geoffhuntsgood.com/squawksatoo.

## Configuration

The app will start by only displaying "Layer" and "Include postgame?".

**Layer:** Allows for selection of any layer in the game.

**Include postgame:** Check to include bananas that are only available after completing the story.

Once a layer is selected, two more options appear.

**Include these:** This section shows several categories of banana, all of which are enabled by default. Click any of them to exclude them from the banana pool. For example, deselecting "Battle" will mean that no Battle Stages will be considered for the random selection.

**How many:** The number of bananas to generate, with a maximum of 5. Choosing this will automatically generate a list of bananas.

## Navigating the Generated List

Once the list is generated and displayed, you have several options.

**Select/Deselect a Banana:** Selecting a banana will check it off and strike it out.

**Keep it coming:** Selecting this will cause a selected banana to "hot-swap" with another randomly selected banana, until all bananas have eventually been selected. If no other bananas are available for the current configuration, the selected banana will remain in the list as checked and struck through.

**Refresh:** This button will completely reset the pool of bananas based on the previously-selected configuration, and will select the same number of bananas again.
